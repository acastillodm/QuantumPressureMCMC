Baryonic feedback applied to Little Things Galaxies.  We use a flat log prior for $M_{v}$ and a linear prior for $c$. Instead, for $M_{star}$ we use a log- normal prior, centered in each mean value of the $M_{*}$ (Table 1 of MNRAS 467, 2019â€“2038 (2017)) and a scatter $\sigma$ is assigned for all galaxies of 0.1 dex.
