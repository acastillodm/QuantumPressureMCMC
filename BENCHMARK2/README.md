Model for baryonic feedback using DC+14 profile. $M_{star}$ is running in the MCMCs. We use a flat log prior for $M_{v}$ and a linear prior for $c$. Instead, for $M_{star}$ we use a log normal distribution prior, centered in each value of the $M_{*}$ (Table 1 of MNRAS 467, 2019–2038 (2017)) and $\sigma$ for all galaxies of 0.1 dex.
